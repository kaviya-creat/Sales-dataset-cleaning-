# Sales Dataset Cleaning

This project is part of a data preprocessing assignment. The goal was to clean a raw sales dataset and produce a well-structured CSV file.

## Files Included

- `raw_data/chocolate_sales.csv`: Original raw dataset in CSV format
- `cleaned_data/cleaned_sales_data.csv`: Cleaned and preprocessed CSV version
- `scripts/data_cleaning_script.ipynb`: Code used to clean the dataset (compatible with Google Colab or Jupyter)

## Data Cleaning Summary

The following preprocessing steps were applied:
- Converted `"Amount"` from string with `$` and `,` to numeric float
- Parsed `"Date"` into `datetime` format
- Renamed all column headers to lowercase with underscores (e.g., `Sales Person` â†’ `sales_person`)
- Removed duplicate rows
- Sorted the dataset by `date` (ascending)
- Filtered data to only include records from: **UK, India, Australia, USA, Canada, and New Zealand**

## Tools Used

- Python with Pandas
